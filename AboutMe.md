- 👋 Hello!  
🌱 I am a graphic designer residing in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
💞️ I have had the privilege of working with various agencies and have gained experience in creating templates and assets for different brands. 
😄 Last year, I focused on improving my skills and pursued a major in UX/UI design.
⚡ As a curious and energetic individual, I thoroughly enjoy participating in team sports. I love to bake desserts and share them with my friends.
